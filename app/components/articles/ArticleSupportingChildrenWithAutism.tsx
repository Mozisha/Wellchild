      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold font-serif text-gray-800 mt-10 first:mt-0">💙 Understanding Autism — and Why Early Support Matters</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), affects how a child communicates, socializes, and experiences the world.
        While autism looks different in every child, early support — especially autism evaluations and Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy — can make a lasting difference in helping children reach their full potential.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        At WellChild Center for Development, we guide families through the autism testing and diagnosis process, then connect them with trusted ABA therapy providers and other specialists across Florida.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold font-serif text-gray-800 mt-10">🧩 Why an Autism Evaluation is the First Step</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        If you notice differences in communication, play, or behavior, an autism evaluation is the first step toward understanding your child’s needs.
        Our licensed psychologists and speech-language pathologists perform comprehensive evaluations that look at:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pl-5">
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Communication and social skills</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Play and imitation</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Emotional regulation</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Repetitive behaviors or sensory differences</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        A clear diagnosis opens the door to early supports like ABA therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy — often covered by insurance once eligibility is established.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold font-serif text-gray-800 mt-10">🌈 What ABA Therapy Is — and How It Helps</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a research-backed therapy that helps children with autism learn meaningful skills and improve daily functioning.
        At its core, ABA focuses on breaking big goals into small, teachable steps. Through structured play, positive reinforcement, and data-based strategies, therapists help children:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pl-5">
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Improve communication and language skills</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Develop social interaction and play</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Strengthen attention and independence</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Reduce frustration and challenging behaviors</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Build routines and coping tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        At WellChild, we collaborate with ABA therapy providers throughout Florida to ensure families can start services quickly — often within weeks of diagnosis, not months.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold font-serif text-gray-800 mt-10">🏡 What Parents Can Do at Home</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        You don’t need to be a therapist to make a difference. Here are daily routines that reinforce ABA principles:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pl-5">
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Use positive reinforcement: praise every success (“You did it!”)</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Give clear, short directions with visuals or gestures</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Provide structured choices (“Do you want the blue cup or the red cup?”)</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Model calm breathing or sensory breaks</li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Build routines and use visual schedules</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        Small, consistent moments add up — especially when paired with professional ABA therapy support.
