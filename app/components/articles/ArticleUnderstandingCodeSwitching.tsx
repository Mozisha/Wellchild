      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        Code-switching refers to the practice of alternating between different languages, dialects, registers, styles, or tones based on social settings or topics. It's a common occurrence among individuals, both children and adults, who are proficient in more than one language or navigate diverse social environments. Contrary to being a language impairment, code-switching demands advanced metalinguistic abilities.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        For many children, the language spoken at home differs from the one used in educational settings. Unfortunately, some academic environments perceive features of nonstandard dialects as errors, causing frustration for these children, who correctly utilize language traits from their home but are directed otherwise. Advocacy is vital as educators need to appreciate and honor the language variations these children bring, as their home language holds a significant place in their identity.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold font-serif text-gray-800 mt-10">Challenges of Code-Switching</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        While it's a valuable tool for effective communication in predominantly monolingual societies, those who code-switch can face anxieties. For instance, children might impulsively speak in their native language at school or attempt to adjust their language to fit in, causing challenges. In work environments, individuals might encounter difficulties aligning their language to fit in or overcome accent biases for better professional opportunities.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        While studies highlight the communicative advantages of bilingualism, those who code-switch face unique challenges. Nevertheless, in monolingual societies, code-switching remains a powerful tool for establishing and sustaining relationships within local and non-local communities.
