      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        Engaging with your child through conversation and play is the most powerful way to support their speech and language development. Here are some practical tips you can use every day.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold font-serif text-gray-800 pt-4">0-24 MONTHS:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc space-y-4 pl-5">
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Narrate everything you do:</strong> Talk to your child as you give them a bath, feed them, and get them dressed. Talk about what you are doing, where you are going, and who you will see. For example: "We are putting on your blue socks!"
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Play back and forth:</strong> Play simple games that involve interaction. Say sounds like “ma, da, and ba” and try to get your baby to say them back to you. Add fun sounds to your sentences, for example, “The cow says moo and the dog says woof, woof.”
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Give lots of praise:</strong> Clap, smile, and celebrate every communication effort. When your child laughs or makes faces, make the same faces back to them. Teach your child to do what you do, like clapping your hands or playing peek-a-boo.
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Use gestures:</strong> Point out everything, including objects, colors, and shapes. Use other gestures like waving, the "stop" gesture, "all done," "give me," and "be quiet."
        </li>
         <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Add on:</strong> Add on to what your baby says. When your baby says, “Mama,” you can say, “Here is Mama. Mama loves you. Where is baby? Here is baby.”
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold font-serif text-gray-800 pt-4">24-36 MONTHS:</h3>
       <ul className="list-disc space-y-4 pl-5">
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Pick a topic:</strong> Talk about fun places you visited or recent activities. Speak clearly and model good speech. Repeat what your child says to show that you understand, then add on to it. For example: “Want juice? I have juice. I have apple juice. Do you want apple juice?”
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Ask Questions in conversations:</strong> Help your child understand and ask questions. Play the yes–no game or ask questions that include a choice to help with comprehension skills.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold font-serif text-gray-800 mt-10">Tips for Any Age</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc space-y-4 pl-5">
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Speak slowly and enunciate:</strong> Clearly pronounce every word to provide a good model.
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Repeat everything:</strong> It is useful for children to hear words over and over again to learn them.
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Listen and respond:</strong> Even if your child is just babbling, respond with a smile or a “yes” to encourage interaction.
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Pause after speaking:</strong> This gives your child a chance to process what you said and respond.
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <strong>Use music:</strong> Sing simple songs and say nursery rhymes. This helps your child learn the rhythm of speech and learn new words.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold font-serif text-gray-800 mt-10">READ TO THEM</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        Read to your child every day. You don’t have to read every word in the book; talking about the pictures is just as valuable. Choose sturdy books with large, colorful pictures. Ask your child, “What’s this?” and encourage them to point to or name objects.
